#watchout

This project shows my first usage of D3.js that I collaborated on with a pair programming partner. We created a game with objects that fly around to random spots in the webpage. If the objects collide with the ship, the current score resets and the highest score is kept.

We tried to mimic the look of the retro Atari Asteroids game.
